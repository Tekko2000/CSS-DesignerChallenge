                <h1>Every Idea <img src="assets/img/idea.png" width="70" alt="#"> starts with a need.</h1>
                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                    attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
                    paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                    sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
                    interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and
                    did not solve any problem.</p>

                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that's not finished or doesn't look perfect. You
                    will
                    learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>

                    start designing. Don't forget to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?</p>
